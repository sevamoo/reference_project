- The encoding we used for Points Of Interests (POIs) for this study are [here](https://github.com/sevamoo/reference_project/blob/master/data/poi_types.csv)


- [The 50 most frquent POIs in Europe](https://github.com/sevamoo/reference_project/blob/master/data/europe_POIs_sorted.csv) 


- [The 50 most frquent POIs in North-America](https://github.com/sevamoo/reference_project/blob/master/data/north-america_POIs_sorted.csv) 


## Free variables to play with: 
```
- POIs: How many most frequents? Or just choosing some of them manually?
- Radius for search?
- What is the similarity threshold to choose an area as a candidate? Now I chose them manually.
```

## Results:


### My quick impression (not necessarily corect)
```
30 features and 300 meters in Europe finds very similar locations in terms of distance to the main rail road node similar to the case in Hardbr√ºcke, but in North American in my opinion 500 meters with 50 features gives better results. 
```


```
**Warning:** The interactive maps could be confusing and you might realize spending time just looking from one point to another point. :)
```

```
Interactive maps show the clusters of points. If you reach to the a single point, click on the circle and there is a link in the popup menue taking you to 3D Google maps.
