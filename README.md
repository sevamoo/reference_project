- The encoding we used for Points Of Interests (POIs) for this study are [here](https://github.com/sevamoo/reference_project/blob/master/data/poi_types.csv)


- [The 50 most frquent POIs in Europe](https://github.com/sevamoo/reference_project/blob/master/data/europe_POIs_sorted.csv) 


- [The 50 most frquent POIs in North-America](https://github.com/sevamoo/reference_project/blob/master/data/north-america_POIs_sorted.csv) 


- Free variables to play with: 
	- POIs: How many most frequents? Or just choosing some of them manually?
	- Radius for search?
	- What would be the similarity threshold to choose a certain area as a long list?




Results:

1- [Results for radius: 500 meters and 30 most frequent Points Of Interests (POIs)](https://sevamoo.github.io/reference_project/mapboxgl_cluster30.html)
